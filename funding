from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error

# Step 1: Data Collection
data = pd.read_csv('school_funding_data.csv')  # Replace 'school_funding_data.csv' with your dataset filename

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
# Perform any necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps here

# Step 3: Feature Selection/Engineering
# Identify and select the relevant features for your pricing model

# Step 4: Model Selection
model = LinearRegression()  # You can choose a different regression model if desired

# Step 5: Model Training
X = data.drop('funding_price', axis=1)  # Replace 'funding_price' with your target variable column name
y = data['funding_price']

X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)  # Adjust the test_size as needed

model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 6: Model Evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_val)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_val, y_pred)
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_val, y_pred)

print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
print("Mean Absolute Error:", mae)

# Step 7: Model Deployment
# You can deploy the model by saving it as a file or creating an API endpoint

# Step 8: Ongoing Monitoring and Maintenance
# Continuously monitor and update the model as new data becomes available
